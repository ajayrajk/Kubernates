 There are four main key concepts  to choice of right database.
 1. Your apllication required super-low latency.
 2. Your data are unstructured , or you do not have any relational data.
 3. You only need to serialize and deserialize data (JSON , XML , YAML, etc.)
 4. You need to store a massive amount of data.
